Auxiliary Readers --- :mod:`MDAnalysis.auxiliary`
=================================================

The auxiliary submodule contains code for reading 'auxiliary' data from a 
trajectory and allowing allignment with trajectory timesteps. Additional 
methods in :class:`MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.Reader` allow auxiliary data to 
be added and read alongside a trajectory.

Auxiliary data are timeseries accompanying a trajectory not stored/read with
the trajectory :class:`~MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.Reader`, and may be stored 
internally (e.g. in an array) or read for a file. In general, auxiliary data is 
assumed to be time ordered and contain no duplicates.

.. _Auxiliary API:

Auxiliary API
-------------
Auxiliary readers inherit from the base 
:class:`~MDAnalysis.auxiliary.base.AuxReader`. In stand-alone use they 
allow iteration over each step in a set of auxiliary data::

    aux = MDAnalysis.auxiliary.xvg.XVGReader('auxdata.xvg')
    for step in aux:
        print step

A base :class:`~MDAnalysis.auxiliary.base.AuxFileReader` is also provided,
extending :class:`~MDAnalysis.auxiliary.base.AuxReader` with attributes/methods 
for when each step is to be read from a file in turn.

A :func:`MDAnalysis.auxiliary.core.get_auxreader_for` function is available to 
return an appropriate :class:`~MDAnalysis.auxiliary.base.AuxReader` instance for
a set of auxiliary data, guessed from the datatype/file extension.


Adding auxiliaries to trajectories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For alignment with trajectory data, auxiliary readers provide methods to 
assign each auxiliary step to the nearest trajectory timestep, read all steps
assigned to a trajectory timestep and calculate 'representative' value(s) of 
the auxiliary data for that timestep. 

'Assignment' of auxiliary steps to trajectory timesteps is determined from time 
of the auxiliary step and the ``dt`` and ``offset`` of the trajectory (provided 
through a :class:`~MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.Timestep` instance ''ts'' 
from the trajectory), as::

    frame = math.floor((time - offset+ts.dt/2)/ts.dt)

If there are no auxiliary steps assigned to a given timestep (or none within 
``cutoff``, if set), the representative 
value is set to ``np.nan``.

Auxiliary data may be added to a trajectory 
(:class:`MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.Reader` object) through the 
:meth:`~MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.ProtoReader.add_auxiliary` method. Auxiliary data
may be passed in as a AuxReader instance, or directly as e.g. a filename, in 
which case :func:`~MDAnalysis.auxiliary.core.get_auxreader_for` is used to 
guess an appropriate reader. e.g.::

    u = MDAnalysis.Universe(PDB, XTC)
    u.trajectory.add_auxiliary('pullforce', './pull_force.xvg')

The auxiliary data will be read appropriately as the trajectory frame is 
updated, and the representative auxiliary value(s) will be available as e.g.
``u.trajectory.ts.aux.pullforce``.

The trajectory :class:`~MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.Reader` methods 
:meth:`~MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.ProtoReader.next_as_aux` and
:meth:`~MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.ProtoReader.iter_as_aux` allow for movement
through only trajectory timesteps to which one or more steps from a given 
auxiliary have been assigned. This may be used when auxiliary data are less
frequent to avoid representative values set to ``np.nan``::

    u.trajectory.add_auxiliary('low_f', 'low_freq_aux_data.xvg')
    for ts in u.iter_as_aux():
        run_analysis(ts.aux.low_f) # do something with auxiliary data

If the auxiliary data are more frequent, 
:meth:`~MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.ProtoReader.next_as_aux` and
:meth:`~MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.ProtoReader.iter_as_aux` behave the same as :meth:`~MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.ProtoReader.next` and 
:meth:`~MDAnalysis.coordinates.base.ProtoReader.__iter__`.


AuxReader class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Registry
........

In order to facilitate guessing of appropriate AuxReaders, all AuxReaders
should set as appropriate `format` attribute. For files, this will be the
expected file extension.


Attributes
..........

The following attributes are inherited from 
:class:`~MDAnalaysis.auxiliary.base.AuxReader`:
  ``name``
      Name under which auxiliary data will be stored in trajectory/Timestep.
  ``represent_ts_as``
      Method to use in calculating representative auxiliary value for a 
      timestep. Default is 'closest'.
  ``cutoff``
      Cutoff (in ps) for ignoring auxiliary steps when calculating 
      representative value(s) for a timestep.
  ``dt``
      Change in time between auxiliary steps (in ps). If not specified, will
      attempt to determine from auxiliary data; otherwise defaults to 1 ps.
  ``initial_time``
      Time of first auxiliary step (in ps). If not specified, will attempt to
      determine from auxiliary data; otherwise defaults to 0 ps.
  ``time_selector``
      Selection key to get time from full set of auxilairy data read with each
      step (``_data__``). Type depends on the auxilairy format - e.g. where 
      data is stored in columns, time_selector may be an index of 'time' column.
      (default value ``None``, in which case step time is calculated from ``dt``
      and ``initial_time``).
  ``data_selector``
      Selection key(s) to get time from full set of auxilairy data read with 
      each step (``__data``). As for ``time_selector``, type depends on 
      auxiliary format.
  ``constant_dt``
      Boolean of whether dt is constant throughout auxiliary data. Default is 
      ``True``.
  ``step``
      Current auxiliary step (0-based).
  ``n_steps``
      Total number of auxiliary steps
  ``_data``
      All recorded data for the current step.
  ``time``
      Time of current auxiliary step, determined from the ``_data`` using 
      ``_select_time()``/``time_selector``, or calculated using ``dt`` and 
      ``initial_time``.
  ``step_data``
      Auxiliary values of interest for the current step, determined from 
      ``_data`` using ``_select_data()``/``data_selector``.
  ``frame_data``
      `step_data` from each auxiliary step assigned to the 
      last-read trajectory timestep.
  ``frame_rep``
      Represenatative value(s) of auxiliary data for last-read trajectory timestep.


:class:`~MDAnalaysis.auxiliary.base.AuxFileReader` additionally provides:
  ``auxfilename``
      Name of the auxiliary file.
  ``auxfile``
      File object for auxiliary file.


Methods
.......
The following methods are inherited from 
:class:`~MDAnalaysis.auxiliary.base.AuxReader`:

  ``__init__(**kwargs)``
    Setup appropriate attributes based on *kwargs*.

  ``__len__()``
    Number of steps in auxiliary data.

  ``next()``
    Advance to next step.

  ``__iter__()``
    Allow iteration through each auxiliary step.

  ``rewind()``
    Reposition to first step.

  ``read_ts(ts)``
    Read auxiliary steps assigned to trajectory step `ts`; if ``name`` is set, 
    update the representative value stored in `ts`, and return.

  ``move_to_ts(ts)``
    Move to the auxiliary step before the trajectory timestep *ts*, such that
    calling 
    :meth:`~MDAnalysis.auxiliary.base.AuxFileReader.auxfile`_read_next_step` 
    reads the first step assigned to *ts* or, when auxiliary data are less 
    frequent and no steps are assigned to *ts*, the first step following *ts*.

  ``step_to_frame(step, ts)``
    Return the frame number of the trajectory described by `ts` to which 
    the auxiliary step `step` is assigned.

  ``step_to_time(step)``
    Return the time of the auxiliary step `step`. 

  ``calc_representative()``
    Return the representative value calculated from ``step_data`` following
    the method specified by ``represent_ts_as`` and ``cutoff``.

  ``__enter__()``
    Entry method for Context Manager (returns self).

  ``__exit__()``
    Exit method for Context Manager (calls ``close()``).

  ``__del__()``
    Calls ``close()``.


Each AuxReader must subclass :class:`~MDAnalysis.auxiliary.base.AuxReader`
and addionally define:

  ``__init__(auxdata, **kwargs)``
    Additional process *kwargs* and any necessary initial processing of 
    *auxdata*. Must :func:`super` through  
    :class:`~MDAnalysis.auxiliary.base.AuxReader`.

  ``_read_next_step()``
    Read the data from the next auxiliary step and set ``_data`` to the list of
    value(s) from each column. Raise `StopIteration` when attempting to read 
    past last step.

  ``count_n_steps()``
    Return the total number of steps.

  ``read_all_times()``
    Return the list of times for each step.

  ``go_to_step(i)``
    Move to and read step `i` (0-based) from the auxiliary data. Raise 
    ValueError when i is out of range

  ``_select_time(key)``
    Return the value indicated by *key* from ``_data`` (the full set of data read 
    in from the current step). Raise ``ValueError`` if *key* is not a valid 
    time selector for the auxiliary format.

  ``_select_data(key)``
    Return, as a ndarray, the value(s) indicated by *key* (may be e.g. a list of 
    multiple individual 'keys') from ``_data``. Raise ``ValueError`` if *key* is 
    not a valid data selector for the auxiliary format.

  ``_empty_data()``
    Return a np.array in the same format as returned by `_select_data`, but with
    all values ``np.nan``; used as the auxiliary value for a trajectory when no 
    auxiliary steps are assigned to the current frame. 


Depending on the format of the auxiliary data, it may also be necessary to 
overwrite the following:
  ``_restart()``
    Reposition before the first step

  ``close()``

For convinience, when reading auxiliary data from a file, step at a time 
(rather than reading the full file at once), 
:class:`~MDAnalysis.auxiliary.base.AuxFileReader` may be used, which 
extends :class:`~MDAnalysis.auxiliary.base.AuxReader`, providing the
following (though these may be overwritten by subclasses as appropriate):
  ``__init__(auxfile, **kwargs)``
    Open *auxfile* and any additional processing of *kwargs*.

  ``_restart()``, 
    Seek to the start of ``auxfile``

  ``close()``
    Close ``auxfile``

  ``go_to_step(i)``
    Iterate through all steps until step `i` is reached.

  ``_reopen()``
    Close ``auxfile`` and reopen.
